# 🎄 Advent of Code 2025 — Day 6: *Trash Compactor*  
Cephalopod-style math… but written in the weirdest possible layout.  

---
  
## 📌 Challenge Summary
You're given a horizontal worksheet where each **problem is arranged vertically**, numbers stacked on top of each other, and the **operator at the bottom**.  
Problems are separated by a **blank column**.  
Part 2 flips everything: numbers must be read **column-wise**, top → bottom, right → left.

---

### **Part 1**
The worksheet arranges each problem vertically.  
Each problem contains:
- Several numbers (top → bottom)  
- A single operator (`+` or `*`) at the bottom  
- Problems separated by a full blank column  

Your goal:  
➡️ **Extract each problem, perform the operation, and sum all problem results.**

---

### **Part 2**
The cephalopods reveal the twist — their math is read **right-to-left**, and each number is given **one digit per row, aligned in its own column**.

Each problem block now:
- Contains multiple **columns**, each representing **one number**  
- Operator still in the bottom row  
- Numbers formed by reading **top → bottom** within each column  

Your goal:  
➡️ **Build numbers column-wise, compute each problem, and sum all answers.**

## 🧠 Solution Outline

### ⚡ Strategy (Optimized for speed)
- Read the worksheet into a uniform grid  
- Scan **column by column** to detect problem blocks  
- For each block:
  - **Part 1:** Build numbers row-wise  
  - **Part 2:** Build numbers column-wise  
- Detect operator from bottom row  
- Use `sum()` or `math.prod()` for fast operations  
- Accumulate grand total in a single pass → **O(R × C)** time
