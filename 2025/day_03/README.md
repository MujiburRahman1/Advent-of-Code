# 🎄 Advent of Code 2025 — Day 3: *Lobby*   
Activate batteries from each bank to form the largest possible joltage while preserving their order.

---

## 📌 Challenge Summary
You’re given multiple battery banks, each represented as a string of digits (1–9).  
Your task is to activate a fixed number of batteries from each bank — in order — to form the **largest possible joltage**.

---

### **Part 1**
You must choose **exactly 2 batteries** from each bank.

Your goal:  
➡️ Form the **largest 2-digit number** by selecting digits while keeping the original order.

---

### **Part 2**
You must choose **exactly 12 batteries** from each bank.

Your goal:  
➡️ Form the **largest 12-digit number** using an optimized ordered subsequence.

## 🧠 Solution Outline

### ⚡ Strategy (Optimized for speed)

#### Part 1 (Linear Time)
- Track the best “tens digit” seen so far  
- Combine it with each next digit to form the largest possible 2-digit number  
- O(n) time per bank, minimal memory  

#### Part 2 (Greedy Monotonic Stack)
- Classic “maximum subsequence of length K” problem  
- Build a stack and:
  - Pop smaller digits when future digits can make a larger number  
  - Ensure enough remaining digits exist to reach 12  
- Take the first 12 digits from the resulting stack  
- O(n) per bank, highly optimized for large inputs
